A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a <p> tag.

Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings. 
There are 6 different levels of headings starting from <h1> to <h6>. The number within a heading tag represents that headingâ€™s level. The largest and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest heading at the lowest level.
Headings are defined much like paragraphs. For example, to create an h1 heading, we wrap our heading text in an <h1> tag.

The <strong> element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important. To define a strong element, we wrap text content in a <strong> tag.

<em> element makes text italic.

HTML parent elements can have many children. Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings.

In order to write an HTML comment, we just enclose the comment with <!-- and --> tags.
